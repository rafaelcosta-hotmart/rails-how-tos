# Creating a New Rails Api 6.0 Project

### Requirements

To create a new Rails Api 6.0 you will be required at least ruby 2.5.0, so if you are below it update your ruby.

#### RVM

Use the Ruby Version Manager to manage your ruby versions.

You can install it with:
```sh
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

And to use it to install the required version you can:
```sh
rvm install ruby-[version]
```

And finally you can use it as your new default ruby:
```sh
rvm --default use 2.4.1
```
